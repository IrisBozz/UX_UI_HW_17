    <p>Hello, I am Iris Zamarripa, UX/UI designer. I specialize in UX Writing, User Research and Information Architecture. 
       I enjoy solving user problems by making a product simple, engaging, and meaningful. I currently reside in my hometown, but was based in Austin, TX. 
       I am proud to say that for the last three years I helped refugees resettle in the United States and helped survivors of Human Trafficking. 
       I love helping people, but I also love technology and design. My goal is to establish myself in a good company that is trying to make a difference in the world.</p>
